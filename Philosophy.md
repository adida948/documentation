## Our Purpose
To empower. To foster sharing, collaboration, abundance and joy.


## Guiding Principles and Founding Beliefs
That knowledge just like life itself, is naturally organic; making it impossible to own knowledge, and impossible to prevent its sharing, distribution, and evolution.

That empowerment is a fundamental right of humankind; that it is morally wrong to disempower someone, by any means.

That collaborating and working together on shared ambitions, is an essential key to success to realise the end goal's full potential. That acting otherwise, duplicates efforts, is disempowering, and stunts growth and innovation on a larger scale.


## Current Goals and Ambitions
- To launch a series of dedicated startup hostels around the world catered directly towards the startup community. To be a home for those wanting to live an international lifestyle, keep their costs down, while travelling, working and still participating in a vibrant physical community of passionate people doing the same.

- To have DocPad overtake WordPress as the defacto tool used to create websites everywhere. Or rather, to have DocPad reach the point where it is empowering millions of web developers all over the world, so they too, can empower others by creating websites quicker than ever before without limitation.

- To have all of the company's internal operations open-sourced (except personal and confidential information of course). This includes things like email and document templates, process documentation, and internal communication.
