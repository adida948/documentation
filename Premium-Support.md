Premium support provides you with support response times within one day when going through our supported support channels. Support is capped to two hours over the month, if the two hours are exceeded you will need to purchase additional hours for that month. Unused hours will not be carried over into the next month. Months are considered to start at the purchase date of the premium support, and finish at the same date the next month. Support is charged per month, per person, in Australian Dollars.

- Email via support@bevry.me
