## DocPad Application

DocPad will send the following information back to Bevry (the company that makes Bevry) so that we can better understand how people are using DocPad, and consequently, make it better because of this.

We track the following events:
- an action is performed (e.g. run, server, etc)
	- so we know how people are using DocPad, so we can focus on the areas that are actually used
- you are asked which skeleton you would like
	- so we know how many users quit or follow through
- you have chosen a skeleton
	- so we can put more resources into more popular skeletons

With those events, we send the following information:
- your username if set
	- so we can learn about user retention and identify problem areas
- docpad version
	- so we know how upgrading is going
- docpad environment
	- so we know whether people mainly run docpad in dev or production
- names of the docpad plugins that are enabled
	- so we can understand which plugins should get attention and which shouldn't
- website's package.json name
	- so we can understand how many websites you are using docpad against
- operating system architecture (e.g. "darwin" for OSX, "win" for Windows)
	- so we can better cater towards different platforms

We also store the following information about yourself:
- email if set
- name if set
- username if set
- country code
- language code
- last login
- first login
