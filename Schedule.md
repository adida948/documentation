Like life, Bevry has limited time and people available to work on it's open-source projects. This schedule will shed some light on what they are currently working on, and how the schedule is calculated.

## Planning

Months are split up in the following way:

- First week: only support, no coding - used to provide official support, while allocating the most important coding tasks for the month
- Middle weeks: only coding, no official support (community support still provided) - used to work on the most important coding tasks for that month, without interuption (bug fixes always come first)
- Last week: verification and releases - used to validate the value of the coding tasks completed, and perform any house cleaning - documentation, fixes, etc.

This separation of duty throughout the weeks allows the Bevry team to remain incredibly focused, without interruption, while accomplishing amazing results.
