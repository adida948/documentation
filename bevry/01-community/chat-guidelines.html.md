Here are some suggestions for our [IRC Support Channels](http://bevry.me/support#irc)

1. Members are from all different time zones, so while hopefully someone will be around right then and there to answer your question, sometimes it may take a while, so waiting patiently will be awesome. [Time zone calculator](everytimezone.com)

1. A lot of users also use tools like [IRCCloud](https://irccloud.com/) so they can record the room's chat history when they are not there and catch up and reply when they get back.

1. As of September 17 2013 we use [BotBot.me](https://botbot.be) to record the [`#docpad` channel's](https://botbot.me/freenode/docpad/) chat history.

1. If you don't get the support you need, check out our other [Support Channels](http://bevry.me/support#premium).

1. If you figure something out, then be sure to catalog the solution on our [Stack Overflow Forum](http://bevry.me/support#stackoverflow) by using the `docpad` tag in your question. It's [totally OK](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/) to answer your own questions as it helps the community as a whole, especially as when someone else hits the same issue as you, they will be able to find the answer thanks to you!

1. We have a few bots on the channel, some allow you to do nifty things
