Please follow the following guidelines whenever you are providing support or offering help for Bevry products.

All of these guidelines mainly cocentrate on one goal, to be as nice *as possible*. This is mainly because a lot of feeling is lost in text and it can be taken very in a very bad way.

A simple example is the following sentence "You are sick!", it's just an example but the person that wrote it meant it in a good way, however the person on the other end can take it *very* badly if he doesn't know well enough to know you use the word "sick" in a good way on a daily basis. So just keep that in mind.

### Apologize

Always make sure to apologize for whatever problem they're having. And empathize/sympathize with the person first, before anything else.

An example of apologizing could be "Hi {{name}}, I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble." or something along those lines. That's a little bit generic though so maybe make it more personal.

### It's not his/her fault

Even if it is, it isn't.

Point out what's happening that's making it go wrong or not work but not what the user did wrong.

This is mainly because the ego is nasty sometimes. The simplest thing like "Oh you used the wrong command..." can affect the user negatively. So always make sure to point out what's wrong, not what the user did wrong.

### Suggest a solution

Of course this is the main meat of your support. Tell the user what he can do to fix it.

At this point you have told him what has gone wrong so now tell him or her how to fix the problem. Do it in as nice a way as possible. Don't make it commands of what he should do but rather make it suggestions.

It's much nicer to be told what you could do instead of being told to do it.

### Leave on a positive note

This step has two parts.

It is about letting the user know how the solution you offered before will help the user and also let the user know you actually care about his or her problem. This can be as simple as explaining *why* your solution will work.

And it is about letting the user know you care. This is a very simple step to take, something like "Hope that helps. :)" is more than enough for this but of course you can use whatever you prefer. :)
