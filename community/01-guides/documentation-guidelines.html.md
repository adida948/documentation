Pull requests must conform to the following criteria:

- **GitHub Flavoured Markdown.** We use [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) for all our documents.
- **Each pull request should have similar changes.** What this means is to not mix typo fix and re-writing in one pull request. Make them separate. Make as many changes as you want in one pull request, just make sure they are related, thus allowing for better organization.
- **International/British English for Text, USA/American English for Code.** We love it when people fix spelling errors and typos! We use International/British English for text (only 27% of our visitors are from the USA), and USA/American English for code. Code examples should (where it makes sense to) comply with the [Bevry Coding Standards](http://bevry.me/bevry/coding-standards). If you don't know what the differences are, no worries, still submit your pull request and we'll merge it in and fix it up after if needed.
- **Explain changes.** Fixing grammar and changing the wording is better if it comes with an included explanation of why the change is being made.
- **No external documentation yet.** We still need to figure out the best way to present the data while avoiding common pitfalls like out of sync or conflicting documentation.

<!-- - **Use the "Files Changed" tab to comment on pull requests.** When commenting on pull request changes, instead of commenting on individual commits, use the pull request's "Files Changed" tab. This allows your comments to persist as the pull request's developers, rather than be forgotten when the next commit comes in. -->
