title: "Install Node.js"
---

This is Bevry's supported guide for installing [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) on your coputer as well as any other required dependencies for your particular system. It may seem seem a bit intimidating, but it's actually really easy and only takes a few minutes.


## On OSX

1. ### [Download & Install Git](http://git-scm.com/download)

2. ### [Download & Install Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

	Once installed, you'll have to install the command line tools. To do this, open Xcode and go to `Preferences -> Downloads -> Command Line Tools -> Install`

	If you installed Xcode over a old non app store version, you'll want to run the follow to ensure everything is pointing to the new xcode location: `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`

3. ### Install Node.js

	1. #### Via the Official Node.js Installer

		1. The simplest and official way to install Node.js

		1. Uninstall any previous Node.js versions you may already have

		1. [Download & Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download)

	1. #### Via [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

		1. NVM allows you to run multiple Node.js versions on the same machine

		1. Uninstall any previous Node.js versions may already have

		1. Prepare Permissions

			``` bash
			sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local
			```

		1. Install NVM

			1. Clone NVM

				``` bash
				git clone git://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm
				```

			2. Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file

				``` bash
				# NVM
				if [ -s ~/.nvm/nvm.sh ]; then
					NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
					source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
				fi
				```

			3. Open a new terminal window or run `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh`

		1. Install Node.js

			``` bash
			nvm install <%- @nodeVersion %>
			nvm alias default 0.8
			nvm use 0.8
			```

	1. #### Via Direct Install

		1. It's the most robust solution, but also requires the most maintenance

		1. Run the following

			``` bash
			export node_version_to_install='<%- @nodeVersion %>'
			curl https://raw.github.com/bevry/community/master/install-node/install-node.sh | sh
			```


## On Apt Linux (e.g. Ubuntu)

Run the following

``` bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl build-essential openssl libssl-dev git python
export node_version_to_install='<%- @nodeVersion %>'
curl https://raw.github.com/bevry/community/master/install-node/install-node.sh | sh
```


## On Yum Linux (e.g. Fedora)

Run the following

``` bash
sudo yum -y install tcsh scons gcc-c++ glibc-devel openssl-devel git python
export node_version_to_install='<%- @nodeVersion %>'
curl https://raw.github.com/bevry/community/master/install-node/install-node.sh | sh
```


## On Windows
