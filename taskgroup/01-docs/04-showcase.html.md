These are libaries and extensions that are built ontop of TaskGroup's robust API.

- [Joe Test Runner](https://github.com/bevry/joe) — Mocha falls down when you have to create your tests dynamically, because Tests in Joe are Tasks, and Suites are TaskGroups, Joe will always know which tests are for which suite. Works tremendously well, with a modular architecture. Also works in the browser!
- [Event Emitter Grouped](https://github.com/bevry/event-emitter-grouped) — Execute event listeners as TaskGroups, adding support for asynchronous listeners, parallel execution, and completion callbacks. Great for plugin infrastructures.
